Predict probabilistic distribution of hourly rain given polarimetric radar measurements
For agriculture, it is extremely important to know how much it rained on a particular field. However, rainfall is variable in space and time and it is impossible to have rain gauges everywhere. Therefore, remote sensing instruments such as radar are used to provide wide spatial coverage. Rainfall estimates drawn from remotely sensed observations will never exactly match the measurements that are carried out using rain gauges, due to the inherent characteristics of both sensors. Currently, radar observations are "corrected" using nearby gauges and a single estimate of rainfall is provided to users who need to know how much it rained. This competition will explore how to address this problem in a probabilistic manner.  Knowing the full probabilistic spread of rainfall amounts can be very useful to drive hydrological and agronomic models -- much more than a single estimate of rainfall.
Unlike a conventional Doppler radar, a polarimetric radar transmits radio wave pulses that have both horizontal and vertical orientations. Because rain drops become flatter as they increase in size and because ice crystals tend to be elongated vertically, whereas liquid droplets tend to be flattened, it is possible to infer the size of rain drops and the type of hydrometeor from the differential reflectivity of the two orientations.

In this competition, you are given polarimetric radar values and derived quantities at a location over the period of one hour. You will need to produce a probabilistic distribution of the hourly rain gauge total. More details are on the data page.

This competition is sponsored by the Artificial Intelligence Committee of the American Meteorological Society. The Climate Corporation has kindly agreed to sponsor the prizes."
